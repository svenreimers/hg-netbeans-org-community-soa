DESC_Element_tBinding=This extension indicates a scheduler protocol based binding.
DESC_Attribute_group=Sub-group name for the set of triggers defined in this Scheduler binding.
DESC_Attribute_dateFormat=Date and time format (http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/api/java/text/SimpleDateFormat.html) used to parse and display date and time values for all defined triggers.
DESC_ComplexType_tOperation=This extension indicates a scheduler protocol based operation.
DESC_Attribute_mode=Mode that Scheduler Binding Component is operating in.
DESC_Element_trigger=Defines a Quartz trigger.
DESC_Attribute_name=Name of the Quartz trigger.
DESC_Attribute_type=Type of Quartz trigger.
DESC_Attribute_enabled=Whether this Quartz trigger is enabled or not.
DESC_Attribute_description=Optional meaningful description for this trigger.
DESC_Attribute_repeat=[simple/hybrid types] How many times the trigger should repeat or the "indefinite" keyword if to repeat indefinitely.
DESC_Attribute_interval=[simple/hybrid types] Interval in milliseconds between firing of trigger.
DESC_Attribute_message=Enter the message that will be sent to the endpoint being triggered.  You can also reference here \
(ex. ${foo}) Application Variables, Java System Properties or Scheduler Inbound Normalized Message Properties.
DESC_Element_tActivePeriod=Defines the active period for triggers defined here.
DESC_Attribute_starting=Specify the date and time when the triggers defined should start once the respective service \
 assembly has been deployed and started, or the "now" keyword if immediately upon deployment and starting.  \
The date and time format is governed by the date-format attribute in the sched:binding element.
DESC_Attribute_ending=Specify the date and time when the triggers defined should end once the respective service \
assembly is running, or the "never" keyword if triggers are to never end.  \
The date and time format is governed by the date-format attribute in the sched:binding element.
DESC_Attribute_cronexpr=[cron/hybrid types] Quartz Cron Expression (http://www.opensymphony.com/quartz/api/org/quartz/CronExpression.html) governing when a Cron or Hybrid trigger fires or begins, respectively.
DESC_Attribute_timezone=[cron/hybrid types] Time Zone ID (http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/api/java/util/TimeZone.html#getAvailableIDs()) \
for the environment where the Cron/Hybrid trigger will be run, and overrides that, if any, specified in the starting or ending attributes. \
If not specified here, then the default time zone of where the application is deployed will be used.
DESC_Attribute_duration=[hybrid type only] Duration period in milliseconds from the beginning time determined by the cron-expr attribute that the trigger will be firing repeatedly per specified interval.

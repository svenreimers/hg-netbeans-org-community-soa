# For Variable Resolver
UNRESOLVED_VARIABLE_TYPE=Type of the variable "{0}" cannot be resolved.
WRONG_VARIABLE_NAMESPACE=The variable "{0}" is used with wrong prefix "{1}". It has to be "{2}".
UNKNOWN_VARIABLE=Cannot find the variable "{0}" in current visibility scope.
VARIABLE_MESSAGE_TYPE_REQUIRED=It is implied that the variable has a message type if a part is specified.
CANT_RETRIEVE_MESSAGE_TYPE=Cannot retrive the type "{0}" of the variable "{1}".
UNKNOWN_MESSAGE_PART=Cannot find the part "{0}" of the variable "{1}". At least 1 part has to be specified for the message before.
SPECIFIC_UNKNOWN_MESSAGE_PART=Cannot find the part "{0}" of the variable "{1}". The only available part "{2}" has to be specified instead.
A_UNKNOWN_MESSAGE_PART=Cannot find the part "{0}" of the variable "{1}". One of possible parts "{2}" has to be specified instead.
A_MESSAGE_PART_REQUIRED=The location path contains the variable "{0}" which has a WSDL message type. One of possible parts "{1}" has to be specified after the variable.

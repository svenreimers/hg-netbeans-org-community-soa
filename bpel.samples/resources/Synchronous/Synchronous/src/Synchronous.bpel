    <documentation>
        The synchronous BPEL process illustrates a simple synchronous flow. The process receives an input message and sends it back synchronously. A client starts the synchronous process by invoking a request-response operation. After invoking a synchronous process, the client is blocked until the process finishes and returns the result.

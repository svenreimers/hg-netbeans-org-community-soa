    BPEL BluePrint 5: Concurrent Asynchronous Coordination of Events Using BPEL<br><br>
        
    Creates a BPEL project and a Composite Application project that
    illustrate concurrent asynchronous coordination of events. Using this pattern
    will enable a BPEL developer to support business processes that involve multiple

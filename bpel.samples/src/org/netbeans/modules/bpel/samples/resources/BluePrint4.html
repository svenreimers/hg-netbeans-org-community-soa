    BPEL BluePrint 4: Message-Based Coordination of Events Using BPEL<br><br>

    Creates a BPEL project and a Composite Application project that
    illustrate message-based coordination of events within the context of an Order
    Fulfillment business process. This pattern describes how a BPEL process can
    respond to events that might occur during execution as well as execute different
    paths based on the received message. Refer to the BPEL BluePrint4 documentation
    for more information on using this project.

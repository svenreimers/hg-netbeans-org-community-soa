<h2>Using the Contiguous Order Operator</h2>

<p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>

<p>The Contiguous Order operator defines a stream that consists of events selected by one or more attributes and then placed in sequence sorted by another attribute.</p>



<p>Assume that you have the following scenario:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A server receives a stream of messages from various hardware devices.</li>
  <li>For each hardware device, the messages have unique IDs (1, 2, 3, 4, and so on).</li>
  <li>Because of an unreliable network, messages may be lost or received in a different order.</li>
  <li>For each hardware device, you want to sort the messages by their unique ID.</li>
</ul>

<p>You could add a Stream Input operator with the following attributes:</p>

<ul>
  <li><tt>deviceID</tt> (VARCHAR)</li>
  <li><tt>msgID</tt> (BIGINT)</li>
  <li><tt>msg</tt> (VARCHAR)</li>
</ul>

<p>You could then connect the Stream Input operator to a Contiguous Order operator.</p>

<p>In the property editor of the Contiguous Order operator, set the partition key to the <tt>deviceID</tt> attribute. 
This setting divides the input stream into multiple substreams, one per device.</p>

<p>In the property editor of the Contiguous Order operator, set the sort value to the <tt>msgID</tt> attribute and the start value to 1.
For each substream, the Contiguous Order operator sorts the messages by their unique ID.</p>

<p>For example, let's say that the messages from one device arrive in the following order: 3, 2, 5, 1, 7, 4, 4, 6.</p>

<p>When message 1 is received, the Contiguous Order operator will output messages 1, 2, and 3. 
When message 4 is received, the Contiguous Order operator will output messages 4 and 5. 
When message 6 is received, the Contiguous Order operator will output messages 6 and 7.</p>

<p>The Contiguous Order operator ignores duplicate events. 
Therefore, the output stream in the hardware device scenario contains only one instance of message 4.</p>

<p>Note that in the output stream, the output from the multiple substreams is interspersed.</p>



<p><strong>To use the Contiguous Order operator:</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li>Drag a Contiguous Order operator from the Palette to the Design view.</li>
  <li>Connect the input of the new Contiguous Order component to an operator that has stream output.</li>
  <li>Double-click the Contiguous Order component. The property editor opens. Notice that the component has inherited the schema of its input stream.</li>

  <li>In the Attributes area, set the Partition Key column to the attribute or attributes that you want to use to divide the input stream into substreams.</li>
  <li>In the Sort By drop-down list, select the attribute that you want to sort by. The attribute must have values that can be sorted sequentially.</li>
  <li>In the Start field, type the attribute value that you want to start with.</li>

  <li>(Optional) Click the Documentation tab and supply notes on this component.</li>
  <li>Click OK.</li>
</ol>

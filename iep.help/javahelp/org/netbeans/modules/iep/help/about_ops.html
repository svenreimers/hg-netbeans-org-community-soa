<h2>About Operator Types </h2>
<p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>

<p>IEP operators can take streams or relations as input. 
The output can be streams, relations, or entire tables.</p>

<p>You can categorize the operators by their input and output.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Stream to Relation.</strong> Operators that take a stream as input, and produce a relation as output with the same schema as the stream.</li>
  <li><strong>Relation to Stream.</strong> Operators that take a relation as input, and produce a stream as output with the same schema as the relation.</li>
  <li><strong>Relation to Relation.</strong> Operators that take one or more relations as input, and produce a relation as output.</li>
  <li><strong>Stream to Stream.</strong> Operators that take a stream as input, and produce a stream as output. The input stream and the output stream can have different schemas.</li>
  <li><strong>Relation to Table.</strong> Operators that take a relation as input, and produce a table as output.</li>
</ul>

<p>In the Palette, the operators are divided into the following categories:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Aggregator.</strong> Aggregate or summarize data.</li>
  <li><strong>Correlation and Filter.</strong> Correlation enables you to obtain data based on the relationship of two pieces of existing data. Filtering enables you to provide information to obtain a subset of data you want.</li>
  <li><strong>External.</strong> Access database tables that are external to the IEP database.</li>
  <li><strong>Input.</strong> Receive data from external sources.</li>
  <li><strong>Output.</strong> Send data to external sources.</li>
  <li><strong>Relation Converter.</strong> Convert a relation to a stream or table.</li>
  <li><strong>Relation Operator.</strong> Perform operations on a relation.</li>
  <li><strong>Sequence.</strong> Order events based on attributes that have sequential order.</li>
  <li><strong>Stream Converter.</strong> Convert stream data to a relation.</li>
</ul>

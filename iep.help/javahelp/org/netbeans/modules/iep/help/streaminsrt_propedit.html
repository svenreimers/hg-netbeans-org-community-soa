<h2>Using the Insert Stream Operator Property Window </h2>
<p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>

<p>The Insert Stream operator converts a relation  into a stream. When the insert stream operation is triggered, all changed or new records are issued.  </p>

<p>In other words, the Insert Stream operator  passes  new records, unlike the Relation Output operator, 
which issues individual records tagged with either a plus (+), meaning a new record, or tagged with minus (-), 
meaning a record that was issued previously, but is no longer part of the relation result. </p>

<p>If you want to output data from the IEP process, use the Insert Stream operator and connect it to a Stream Output operator.</p>

<p><strong>To create an Insert Stream operator:</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li>Drag an Insert Stream operator from the Palette to the Design view.</li>
  <li>As needed, connect the input of the new Insert Stream component to an operator that has Relation output.</li>
  <li>Double-click the Insert Stream component. The property editor opens. Notice that the component has inherited the schema of its input relation.</li>
  <li>As needed, configure the following property: Name.</li>
  <li>(Optional) Click the Documentation tab and supply notes on this component.</li>
  <li>Click OK.</li>
</ol>

<p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>
<p>The Delete Stream operator converts the deleted records of a changed relation into a stream. The operator takes all records that are in a previous table but not in the current table and puts them into a stream with a timestamp.</p>
<p><strong>To create a Delete Stream operator:</strong></p>
<ol>
  <li>Drag a Delete Stream operator from the Palette to the Design view.</li>
  <li>As needed, connect the input of the new Delete Stream component to an operator that has Relation output.</li>
  <li>Double-click the Delete Stream component. The property editor opens. Notice that the component has inherited the schema of its input relation.</li>
  <li>As needed, configure the following property: Name.</li>
  <li>(Optional) Click the Documentation tab and supply notes on this component.</li>
  <li>Click OK.</li>
</ol>

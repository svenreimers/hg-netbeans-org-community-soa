<h2>Using the Batched Stream Output Operator</h2>

<p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>

<p>The Batched Stream Output operator enables you to output events in batches, rather than one event at a time.</p>

<p>Depending on the downstream JBI component, this approach can improve performance. 
For example, if you are using IEP with the File Binding Component, sending 10 events at a time might be faster than sending one event at a time.</p>



<p><strong>To use the Batched Stream Output operator:</strong></p>

<ol>

  <li>Drag a Batched Stream Output operator from the Palette to the Design view.</li>
  <li>Connect the input of the new Batched Stream Output component to an operator that has stream output.</li>
  <li>Double-click the Batched Stream Output component. The property editor opens. Notice that the component has inherited the schema of its input stream.</li>

  <li>If you want to include a timestamp on the output, then select the Include Timestamp check box.</li>

  <li>In the Batch Size field, specify the number of events in a batch.</li>

  <li>In the Maximum Delay field and drop-down list, specify the maximum amount of time that the operator will wait before sending a batch.<br>
      For example, assume that the batch size is 10 and the maximum delay is 30 seconds. 
      If 30 seconds have passed since the previous batch was sent, and only eight events have arrived, then the operator sends the eight events.</li>

  <li>(Optional) Click the Documentation tab and supply notes on this component.</li>
  <li>Click OK.</li>

</ol>

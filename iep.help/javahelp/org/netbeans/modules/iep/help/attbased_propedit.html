<h2>Using the Attribute Based Window Operator</h2>
<p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>



<p>The Attribute Based Window operator converts an input stream to a relation based on a specified attribute and a size that defines the range of values for the attribute.</p>

<p>Assume that you select an attribute that has the INTEGER data type and that you set the size to 10. 
If the most recently received event has a value of 50 for the attribute, then the relation consists of all events that have a value of between 40 and 50 for the attribute.</p>

<p>The following data types are supported: INTEGER, BIGINT, DOUBLE, DATE, and TIMESTAMP. You cannot select an attribute that has the VARCHAR data type.</p>

<p>The input to the Attribute Based Window operator is a stream.</p>

<p>The output from the Attribute Based Window operator is a relation.</p>



<p><strong>To use the Attribute Based Window operator:</strong></p>

<ol>

  <li>Drag an Attribute Based Window operator from the Palette to the Design view.</li>

  <li>Connect the output of an operator that has stream output to the input of the Attribute Based Window operator.</li>
  <li>Double-click the Attribute Based Window operator. The property editor opens. The attributes of the input schema are displayed in read-only mode.</li>

  <li>In the Attribute drop-down menu, select the attribute that you want to track.</li>

  <li>In the Size field, enter a numerical value that the operator will use to define the range of values. 
      The operator determines the lowest value of the range by subtracting the size from the attribute value of the most recently received event.<br>
      For attributes with the DATE data type, the size represents the number of days.<br>
      For attributes with the TIMESTAMP data type, the size represents the number of seconds.</li>

  <li>(Optional) Click the Documentation tab and supply notes on this component.</li>
  <li>Click OK.</li>

</ol>
